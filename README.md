# atelier

**Tiered-delegation task execution for Claude Code.** A planner model writes the spec
into sprints, a cheap model executes and self-verifies against the gate — same gate
quality as the strong model, **~64% cheaper** (≈⅓ the cost) ([benchmarked](eval/RESULTS.md)).

> Offload each sprint of work to the **weakest model that can do it correctly.**

## The idea

Most of the work in a task is pattern-following execution, not reasoning. atelier
concentrates planning in one model and pushes execution down to a cheap one, with the
**gate (tests / a checklist) as the trust contract** — independently re-run, never
self-reported. This generalizes "tests as the source of truth" to any task, code or not.

### Benchmarked architecture

The configuration that won the cost/quality bake-off (spec → working code, 7 tasks across
JS / Python / Go / prose, gate-verified — see [`eval/RESULTS.md`](eval/RESULTS.md) and
[`experiments/`](experiments/README.md)):

```text
spec ──▶ Sonnet  writes contract (pins cross-sprint + genuinely-ambiguous decisions)
                 + sprints.jsonl (one self-contained unit of work each)
            │
            ▼
         Haiku   one cached agent builds every sprint, runs the gate, and self-fixes
            │
            ▼
         Sonnet  a SCOPED patch — only if a specific failure is left (in practice: never;
                 the Haiku agent self-fixed to green on all 7 tasks)
```

**Result: ~64% cheaper than Opus building the same spec, at equal gate quality.** Two
things make it work: a single cached agent reuses the contract across turns (cheap, no
cold-call bloat), and the contract **pins every decision that crosses a sprint boundary**
so the executor never invents a system-level choice (leave one ambiguous and the executor
writes contradictory tests). Opus is *not* in the execution loop.

## Lineage

atelier generalizes three existing systems to arbitrary tasks:

- **speed-run** — offload first-pass generation to a fast model; the strong model
  does architecture and *surgical* fixes, never wholesale regeneration.
- **pipelines/local_code_gen** — a strong architect pins every cross-sprint decision
  in a contract so the weak executor never makes a system-level choice.
- **Noospheric Orrery** — proof of the philosophy: Sonnet never extracts; Haiku
  does all the work; Sonnet writes and refines the spec until the cheap model
  reliably passes.

Where `local_code_gen` writes 600-line byte-pinned contracts for a tiny local
model (qwen3.6 / gemma), atelier deliberately sits well above that floor. **Haiku
is far stronger**, so the contract pins only what is *cross-sprint AND genuinely
ambiguous* — the seams, not the interiors. Since Opus/Sonnet output is the
expensive part, terseness is the goal: pin the few decisions two capable sprints
would otherwise diverge on, and let Haiku infer the rest.

## Skills

| Skill | Role | Model | Runs as |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `atelier` | orchestrator | — | this session |
| `atelier-plan` | director's planning discipline | Opus | this session |
| `atelier-brief` | expand a unit spec into a brief *(split tier)* | Sonnet | dispatched subagent |
| `atelier-execute` | execute one unit | Haiku | dispatched subagent |
| `atelier-check` | verify + fix one unit | Sonnet | dispatched subagent |

## Planning tiers (who writes the briefs)

- **direct** — Opus writes the contract *and* every brief. Fewest moving parts, one
  translation boundary. Best for **few sprints / subtle, correctness-critical work**.
- **split** — Opus (director) writes the contract + terse unit specs; **Sonnet**
  brief-writers expand them in parallel (mirrors `local_code_gen`'s
  Opus-contract → Sonnet-sprint flow). The bulky brief-writing drops to the
  5×-cheaper tier and Opus's context stays lean. Best for **many sprints (≳ 6) /
  mechanical briefs / scale**.
- **hybrid** — Opus writes the 1–2 subtle sprints' briefs, Sonnet the routine rest.

Rough rule: direct below ~5 sprints, split above — but it's per-task, and the subtle
sprints can stay direct even in a split run. Authority follows the tier: Opus owns
the contract (cross-sprint), the brief-writer owns its unit (within-sprint), so a
within-sprint fix routes to cheap Sonnet and only contract defects reach Opus.

## Usage

Say **"atelier"**, **"delegate this"**, or **"tiered build"** on a multi-part task.
The orchestrator will: frame the goal, plan (write `CONTRACT.md` + per-sprint briefs
with acceptance criteria, confirmed with you), dispatch Haiku executors in parallel
where dependencies allow, **verify each unit by criterion type** (run the gate for
runnable criteria; spend a Sonnet read only when a gate fails or there are
assertional criteria to judge), apply a bounded tiered fix loop, then do a final
coherence pass and report.

### Verification is adaptive (don't pay Sonnet to read passing code)

- **Runnable criteria** (tests, build, a CLI exit code) → the orchestrator just
  **runs the gate**. Pass = done, no model spent. This is still independent
  verification (the gate is re-run, not self-reported).
- **A gate fails** → a Sonnet checker reads the failure and surgically fixes it.
- **Assertional criteria** (prose, citations, canon, design quality) → a Sonnet
  checker reads and judges *those* dimensions.

So for code-with-tests the common path costs no checker tokens; Sonnet is spent only
on failures and on things only a reader can judge.

Artifacts land in `docs/atelier/<task-slug>/` (`CONTRACT.md`, `briefs/`,
`LEDGER.md`) so a run is auditable and resumable.

### Decomposition modes

Not every task is "one file per agent." The architect picks a mode by how cohesive
the final artifact must be:

- **partition** — sprints own separate regions/files, run in **parallel**, architect
  merges. Best for separable outputs (code files, doc sections).
- **relay** — one shared artifact extended segment by segment, **sequentially**,
  each agent reading the artifact-so-far. Best for flowing prose (a story chapter).
- **layered** — role-specialized passes over the whole artifact (draft → continuity
  edit → polish), **sequentially**. Best for one seamless voice via multiple lenses.

A single artifact with no cross-sprint seams skips the contract entirely — one brief,
one execute, one check (or just don't use atelier).

## Fix loop (bounded, terminates)

The checker diagnoses (`pass` / `local` / `execution` / `brief`); the orchestrator
decides and counts:

1. **surgical** (Sonnet, in place) — ≤ 2
2. **executor redo** (fresh Haiku + notes) — ≤ 1
3. **architect replan** (revise contract/brief) — ≤ 1
4. otherwise **surface to the human**

A regression guard rolls back any fix that breaks a previously-passing criterion.

## Design & evidence

The benchmarked architecture and the full cost/quality investigation (including the
approaches we tried and rejected) are in [`eval/RESULTS.md`](eval/RESULTS.md); reproducible
scripts + captured data are in [`experiments/`](experiments/README.md).

## Two implementations

- **Lean dispatch flow (benchmarked, recommended)** — `atelier-dispatch`: Sonnet writes
  `contract.md` + `sprints.jsonl`, one cached Haiku agent builds + self-fixes, scoped
  Sonnet patch if needed. ~64% cheaper than Opus at equal gate quality. This is the
  architecture diagrammed at the top.
- **Subagent substrate (richer, pricier)** — the `atelier-*` skills above (Opus architect
  → parallel Haiku executor subagents → Sonnet checker). More expensive in the bake-off
  (per-subagent harness + orchestrator context re-read); reach for it only when you need
  per-sprint *parallel* verification. Still uses "unit/brief" terminology internally.

## Status

v0.1 — **benchmarked.** The lean dispatch flow is ~64% cheaper than Opus building the same
spec, at equal gate quality, across 7 tasks (JS / Python / Go / prose). Evidence:
[`eval/RESULTS.md`](eval/RESULTS.md) (main findings + full journey) and
[`experiments/`](experiments/README.md) (reproducible scripts + captured cost data).
